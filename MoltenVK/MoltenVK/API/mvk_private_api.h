#pragma mark MoltenVK configuration

/**
 * MoltenVK provides the ability to configure and optimize MoltenVK for your particular
 * application runtime requirements and development-time needs.
 *
 * At runtime, configuration can be helpful in situtations where Metal behavior is different
 * than Vulkan behavior, and the results or performance you receive can depend on how MoltenVK
 * works around those differences, which, in turn, may depend on how you are using Vulkan.
 * Different apps might benefit differently in this handling.
 *
 * Additional configuration parameters can be helpful at development time by providing 
 * you with additional tracing, debugging, and performance measuring capabilities.
 *
 * Each configuration parameter has a name and value, and can be passed to MoltenVK
 * via any of the following mechanisms:
 *
 *   - The standard Vulkan VK_EXT_layer_settings extension (layer name "MoltenVK").
 *   - Application runtime environment variables.
 *   - Build settings at MoltenVK build time.
 *
 * Parameter values configured by build settings at MoltenVK build time can be overridden
 * by values set by environment variables, which, in turn, can be overridden during VkInstance
 * creation via the Vulkan VK_EXT_layer_settings extension.
